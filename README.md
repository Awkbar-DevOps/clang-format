# clang-format

**Clang-format** container image creator.

This image is used by the [Github Super-Linter](https://github.com/super-linter) to help build out the `clang-format` linter.
Due to this having to be compiled and built, it takes areound `15-20` minutes to build, and adds significantly to the build times of the **GitHub Super-Linter**.
